				<p><strong>Not so brieflly about me</strong> </p>
					<p>My name is Paulo Pimenta and I am not an ordinary software developper. If you clicked here I believe you wanted to know more about me
					and you want now know why I consider myself a no ordinary software developper. To answer these two questions, I will start 
					from the end: the reason why I created this blog.</p>
					
					<p>I always liked to help people, sharing my knowledge whatever team I would be part of. As much I have learned from my collegues,
					I have always wanted to give it back. If not directy to people that helped them, to others. I also enjoy writting, so I decided to create this blog to practice my writting skills.
					blog to practice my english writting skillls. By the way, I suppose that, at this point, you have already noticed that I am not a native English writter.</p>
					
					<p>But how did I get here ? Well, After I failed the exams to enter to medicine faculty school, I noticed, around 1999, that my interests towards computers
					were much greater than my those about the human body. Hopefully I declined my efforts to get to and decided to follow my true passiom.
					I went to collegue of information systems and I dived in the world of computers, programming languages and networks. 
					I have learned that if computer science is, and should be usefull only if it is able to solve a problem. Moreover, living in the Amazon region
					on that time, lead me to believe that computer science applied to envinroment could be a new field and solution to my issues that we usually
					encounter in that region. The day I was lectured about geographic information systems reinforced what I believed. And that where my 
					story with GIS begins.</p>
					

					<p>An how did I get here ? Well, I failed the exams to enter to medicine school. Only to realize later, in 1999, that my interests 
					towards computers were much greater than my those about the human body. Hopefully I decided to follow my intuintion an I went to 
					collegue, to pursue an information systems degree. I dived in the world of computers, programming languages and networks. 
					I have learned that if computer science is very useful (and profits from) on solving problems found in other sciences. Living in the Amazon 
					region on that time, lead me to believe that computer science applied to envinroment could be an interesting starting field to help
					some common evenrironmental issues that we encounter in that region. And the day I was lectured about geographic information systems definied
					and reinforced what I believed. That where my story with GIS begins.</p>
					
					<p>Although I had professional experience as a softawre developer both web and desktop platforms. My focus was alaywas GIS. Later, I dediced to
					start my masters in the wondeful world of modelling, focusing land use and land cover modelling. As my interest about modelling grew stronger,
					I have also noticed that modelling was like a black block to noviced, so I wanted to help to decrease this distance between modelling tools and
					normal non-programmer users. So I decided to move to Montpellier, in France, and pursue a PhD at the University of Montpelier. During my PhD, 
					I used software engineering aproach called Model Driven Engineer (MDE). I used MDE to develop a programming language called B-Reactive, a language to specify reactive behaviour in multi-agent
                    systems. After I graduated from my PhD, I started to dive in the wonderful world of Python. I was, naturally,
                    led to search for Python applications in modelling and web development, such as Scikit Learn and Django.
					Continously learning, my goals are to use my skills in the domain of GIS, web developpment and modelling.
